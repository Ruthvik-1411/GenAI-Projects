# Gen AI Mini Projects
This is a repo to implement some Gen AI usecases that seemed interesting.
List of projects/ideas I plan to implement:
- ChatBots
  - [x] Basic ChatBot (Text inputs)
  - [x] Basic ChatBot (Multimodal inputs)
  - [x] RAG Based ChatBot (simple data)
  - [ ] RAG Based ChatBot (Complex datasets, using different techniques)
- NL2SQL
  - [ ] Basic NL2SQL Bot on simple data. (Use existing expense data for CY24)
  - [ ] NL2SQL Bot with visualizations (Use Google Charts)
  - [ ] Agentic N2SQL Bot (yet to decide)
  - [ ] Insights generator (decompose queries)
- Webscraping
  - [ ] Simple Webscraping Agent
- Image Generation
  - [ ] Youtube Thumbnail Generator. (Give url and image style(optional), image can be generated)
  - [ ] Dress picker (Upload all images of clothes and recommendations can be provided based on occasion)
  - [ ] Image generation using open source models.

* I'll add more ideas as they come up.

_Note: These implementations are just to have a hands on experience with the latest models and frameworks. The code might not always be written as per best practices, but I try to do as much as I can. I will also be adding any learning for topics that I found interesting when implementing these mini projects._
