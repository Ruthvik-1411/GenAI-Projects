# Gen AI Mini Projects
This is a repo to implement some Gen AI usecases that seemed interesting.
List of projects/ideas I plan to implement:
- **ChatBots**
  - [x] Basic ChatBot -> [simple-gemini-chatbot](https://github.com/Ruthvik-1411/GenAI-Projects/tree/main/simple-gemini-chatbot#simple-multimodal-chatbot)
  - [x] RAG Based ChatBot (basic) -> [simple-rag-chatbot-with-mesop-ui](https://github.com/Ruthvik-1411/GenAI-Projects/tree/main/simple_rag_bot#simple-rag-chatbot-with-mesop-ui)
  - [ ] RAG Based ChatBot (Complex datasets, using different techniques)
      + Diverse domains, something llm's are not trained on.
      + Various File formats, PDF, Docx, HTML, images, txt. Multimodal embeddings.
      + Rich enough data for retrieval + generations + evals using different techniques for chunking, retrieving...
- **NL2SQL**
  - [ ] Basic NL2SQL Bot on simple data with viz. (Use existing expense data for CY24/similar samples)
  - [ ] Agentic N2SQL Bot (Generate insights, decompose queries, recommendations using adv techniques)
- **Webscraping**
  - [ ] Simple Webscraping Agent to generate reports. (Kind of like deep research)
- **Image Generation**
  - [ ] Youtube Thumbnail Generator. [InProgress](https://github.com/Ruthvik-1411/GenAI-Projects/tree/main/yt_thumbnail_generation)
  - [ ] Dress picker (Upload all images of clothes and recommendations can be provided based on occasion)
  - [ ] Short story generator with images. (Generates image slides to depict a story)
- **Live Application** (Multimodal Live)
  - [ ] Automated bank teller (simple live call agent to provide a/c balance)
  - [ ] Simple Jarvis agent with access to some data and bunch of tools.(Starts with a wake word)

* I'll add more ideas as they come up.

_Note: These implementations are just to have a hands on experience with the latest models and frameworks. The code might not always be written as per best practices, but I try to do as much as I can. I will also be adding any learning for topics that I found interesting when implementing these mini projects._
