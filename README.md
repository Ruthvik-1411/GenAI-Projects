# Gen AI Mini Projects
This is a repo to implement some Gen AI usecases that seemed interesting.
List of projects/ideas I plan to implement:
- ChatBots
  - [ ] Basic ChatBot (Text inputs)
  - [ ] Basic ChatBot (Multimodal inputs) (Covers first one as well)
  - [ ] RAG Based ChatBot (simple data)
  - [ ] RAG Based ChatBot (Complex datasets, using different techniques) (yet to decide)
- NL2SQL
  - [ ] Basic NL2SQL Bot on simple data
  - [ ] NL2SQL Bot with visualizations (Use Google Charts)
  - [ ] Agentic N2SQL Bot (yet to decide)

Will add more ideas as they come.
