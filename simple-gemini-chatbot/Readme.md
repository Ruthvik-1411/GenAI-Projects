## Simple Multimodal Chatbot
This is a basic implementation of chat interface with Gemini models. 
- The setup uses streamlit for UI and Langchain framework for model inference(very basic).
- Uses Gemini API key from Google AI studio.

### Some Key features
- Uses Multimodal models from google for inference.
- Option to choose from a list of available models.
- Short term persistent memory stored in session states. (New session can be created as required)
- File display in message window to list files upload during the session per each message.

**Further steps can include addition of prompts to align the chatbot with specific usecase. Since the goal was to just implement a basic chatbot, this was not done.**
