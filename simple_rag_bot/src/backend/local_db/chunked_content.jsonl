Extensions connect Agents to External APIs\nExtensions can be crafted independently of the agent, but should be provided as part of the \nagent\u2019s configuration. The agent uses the model and examples at run time to decide which \nExtension, if any, would be suitable for solving the user\u2019s query. This highlights a key strength \nof Extensions, their built-in example types, that allow the agent to dynamically select the \nmost appropriate Extension for the task. \n \nFigure 5. 1-to-many relationship between Agents, Extensions and APIs\nAgents\n15\nSeptember 2024\nThink of this the same way that a software developer decides which API endpoints to use \nwhile solving and solutioning for a user\u2019s problem.

For example, about half of the \nmodels leave out either, or a combination of, land \nuse change, black carbon (created by the incomplete \ncombustion of fossil fuels, wood, or biomass), or \nthe indirect effects of sulphate aerosols (the direct \neffect of sulphate aerosols is to scatter and reflect \nlight, while their indirect effect is to influence \ncloud lifetimes and reflectivity).\nWhen a strong warming influence from carbon \ndioxide is included, coupled with a strong cooling \neffect from aerosols over the mid-century interval, \nthe models provide a closer simulation of the \nglobal average (Figure 8). On this basis, the IPCC \nconcludes that recent warming is unlikely to be \ndue solely to natural causes, and instead is \u201cvery \nlikely\u201d due to greenhouse gases. \nD e t e r m i n i n g  t h e  C a u s e s  o f", "page_span": [30], "chunk_metadata": {"start_char_idx": 49730, "end_char_idx": 50712}, "document_metadata": {"url": "/home/ruths/ubuntu_env/GenAI-Projects/simple_rag_bot/src/backend/../../documents/understanding-climate-change-2008.pdf", "title": "understanding-climate-change-2008.pdf"}}

Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al.\n2023)\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks.\nThere are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and\narguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\nInstruction:\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\",\ntask_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL,", "page_span": [10, 11], "chunk_metadata": {"start_char_idx": 16938, "end_char_idx": 17865}, "document_metadata": {"url": "/home/ruths/ubuntu_env/GenAI-Projects/simple_rag_bot/src/backend/../../documents/LLM Powered Autonomous Agents _ Lil'Log.pdf", "title": "LLM Powered Autonomous Agents _ Lil'Log.pdf"}}

The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous\ntask which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A\nspecial tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in\nthe dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the\nfollowing options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship\nbetween tasks, please note their order. If the user input can't be parsed,\nyou need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{\nDemonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}.

The selection of APIs is quite diverse,\nincluding search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule\nmanagement, health data management, account authentication workflow and more.
